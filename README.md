The Java client library for the **Boson Active Proxy** — a Boson layer-2 service that lets any device expose a local service to the public internet, even when it is behind NAT, a firewall, or has no public IP address.

## What Is Active Proxy?

Active Proxy is a layer-2 service built on the Boson DHT network. It solves the classic NAT traversal problem: a service running on a laptop, a Raspberry Pi, or any machine behind a home router can be reached from anywhere on the internet without port forwarding, a VPN, or a static IP.

A **Boson Super Node** running the Active Proxy service acts as the public relay:

- It holds a **public IP address** and allocates a TCP port (or a DNS name, for subscribed clients) that the outside world can connect to.
- The client library maintains an **encrypted, authenticated tunnel** from your machine outward to that super node.
- Incoming external connections are multiplexed through this tunnel and forwarded to your local upstream service transparently.

---

## How It Works

```
  External User
       │  TCP connect to public endpoint
       ▼
 ┌─────────────────────────────────┐
 │  Active Proxy Super Node        │  ← public IP, optional DNS name
 │  (Boson layer-2 service)        │
 └─────────────────────────────────┘
       │  Encrypted tunnel (NaCl / CryptoBox)
       │  Challenge → Auth → Attach → Data
       ▼
 ┌──────────────────────────────────┐
 │  ActiveProxyClient (this lib)    │  ← your machine, any network
 └──────────────────────────────────┘
       │  plain TCP (loopback or LAN)
       ▼
 ┌─────────────────┐
 │  Your service   │  e.g. HTTP, SSH, any TCP service
 └─────────────────┘
```

1. **Startup** — The client resolves the Active Proxy service peer via a DHT `FIND_PEER` lookup using the configured `peerId`, then opens a TCP connection to the super node.
2. **Handshake** — A mutual challenge–response exchange authenticates the client using its Ed25519 user and device keys. The channel is then encrypted with NaCl `CryptoBox` (X25519 + XSalsa20-Poly1305).
3. **Attach** — The client registers its upstream service address with the super node, which allocates a public endpoint (`ip:port`, and optionally a DNS hostname served over HTTPS for subscribed users; see [Public endpoints](#public-endpoints)).
4. **Data relay** — For each incoming external TCP connection, the super node sends a `CONNECT` packet through the tunnel. The client opens a new connection to the local upstream service and bridges the two streams until either side disconnects.
5. **Keepalive** — `PING`/`PING_ACK` packets keep the tunnel alive and detect network failures.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Version                    |
|---|----------------------------|
| Java JDK | 17 or later                |
| Apache Maven | 3.8 or later               |
| Boson Core (`boson-api`) | same version or compatible |

---

## Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bosonnetwork/Boson.ActiveProxy.Client.git
cd Boson.ActiveProxy.Client
./mvnw clean package
```

The compiled JAR is placed in `target/lib/boson-active-proxy-client-<version>.jar`.

To skip tests:

```bash
./mvnw clean package -DskipTests
```

---

## Adding as a Dependency

Add the following to your Maven `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.bosonnetwork</groupId>
    <artifactId>boson-active-proxy-client</artifactId>
    <version>${boson.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

The library requires a Vert.x instance and a running Boson `Node` (from `boson-core-dht`) to be provided by the caller.

---

## Configuration

The client is configured via a YAML file or programmatically through the `Configuration.Builder`.

### YAML configuration file

```yaml
# Active Proxy service peer.
# peerId is required. The client resolves host/port via DHT if omitted.
service:
  peerId: GbRwG3WgKgApSDBr9FGo5Y3RssSWxfWhanXMBdPCo5F2
  # host: 192.168.8.80   # optional: skip DHT lookup and connect directly
  # port: 9090

# Client identity.
# Provide either userPrivateKey (which implies userId) or just userId.
# devicePrivateKey is always required.
client:
  userId: AAqCZmUwD5hPAwNZBUsf1xsqsuWMUK74za3r6b9dgioD
  # userPrivateKey: <Base58 or 0x-prefixed hex Ed25519 private key>
  devicePrivateKey: <Base58 or 0x-prefixed hex Ed25519 private key>

# The local service to expose.
upstream:
  host: 127.0.0.1
  port: 8888
  scheme: http       # URI scheme of the upstream; defaults to http

# Request a DNS hostname from the super node, served as https://<name>.
# Requires an http upstream, and the super node may decline it (subscription).
nameAccess: false

# Announce the proxied endpoint to the DHT for peer discovery.
announcePeer: false
```

### Configuration fields

| Section | Field | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `service` | `peerId` | Yes | DHT peer ID of the Active Proxy super node. |
| `service` | `host` | No | Direct hostname/IP of the super node. Skips DHT lookup when set. |
| `service` | `port` | No | Direct TCP port of the super node. Required together with `host`. |
| `client` | `userId` | Conditional | Boson user ID (public key as Base58). Required if `userPrivateKey` is absent. |
| `client` | `userPrivateKey` | Conditional | Ed25519 private key (Base58 or `0x`-hex). Derives `userId` automatically. |
| `client` | `devicePrivateKey` | Yes | Device-specific Ed25519 private key. Identifies this device to the service. |
| `upstream` | `host` | Yes | Host of the local service to expose. |
| `upstream` | `port` | Yes | Port of the local service to expose. |
| `upstream` | `scheme` | No | URI scheme of the upstream (`http`, `https`, `tcp`, `ssh`, ...), used as the scheme of the port-mapped endpoint. Case-insensitive; a trailing `://` is accepted and removed. Defaults to `http`, so non-HTTP services should set it. |
| — | `nameAccess` | No | Request a DNS name for the public endpoint, served as `https://<name>`. Requires `scheme: http`. Defaults to `false`. |
| — | `announcePeer` | No | Announce the proxied endpoint to the DHT. Defaults to `false`. |

### Programmatic configuration

```java
Configuration config = Configuration.builder()
    .service(Id.of("GbRwG3WgKgApSDBr9FGo5Y3RssSWxfWhanXMBdPCo5F2"))   // or service(peerId, host, port)
    .userKey("<Base58-private-key>")        // derives userId automatically
    .deviceKey("<Base58-private-key>")
    .upstream("127.0.0.1", 8888, "http")
    .nameAccess(false)
    .announcePeer(false)
    .build();
```

`build()` throws `IllegalStateException` naming the offending field when the configuration is incomplete or inconsistent, for example name access with a non-`http` upstream.

### Public endpoints

Once connected, the super node allocates up to two public endpoints:

| Endpoint | Form | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Port-mapped | `<upstream scheme>://<ip>:<port>` | Always allocated. Bytes are relayed unchanged, so it speaks whatever the upstream speaks, including end-to-end TLS for an `https` upstream. |
| Named | `https://<name>` | Only with `nameAccess: true`, when the super node grants it. |

The named endpoint is fronted by the super node's reverse proxy (Nginx or Caddy), which terminates TLS and routes each request by its HTTP `Host` header. That is why name access requires a plain `http` upstream:

- **TLS belongs at the super node.** An `https` upstream would make the reverse proxy open a second TLS session to it through the Active Proxy tunnel, which is already encrypted, spending the super node's resources for no added protection.
- **It is not end to end.** The super node sees the decrypted HTTP traffic. A service that needs TLS all the way to the upstream should use the port-mapped endpoint instead.

## Usage

```java
// Obtain a running Boson node and a Vert.x instance (application-provided).
Node node = ...;
Vertx vertx = ...;

// Load configuration from a YAML map or build programmatically.
Configuration config = Configuration.fromMap(yamlMap);

// Create and start the client.
ActiveProxyClient client = new ActiveProxyClient(vertx, node, config);
client.addConnectionListener(new ConnectionStatusListener() {
    @Override
    public void connected() {
        // The endpoints exist only while the tunnel is up, so read them here.
        System.out.println("Tunnel connected. Public endpoint: " + client.getEndpoint());
        client.getNamedEndpoint().ifPresent(named -> System.out.println("Named endpoint: " + named));
    }

    @Override
    public void disconnected() {
        System.out.println("Disconnected from Active Proxy service.");
    }
});

// start() completes once the session is deployed; the tunnel then authenticates and
// connected() reports the endpoints. The client keeps reconnecting on its own after that.
client.start().get();

// ...

// Stop when done.
client.stop().get();
```

### Standalone client

The module also ships a command line launcher that runs the client without a DHT node. `./mvnw package` assembles it under `target/dist`:

```
target/dist/bin/active-proxy.sh
target/dist/lib/*.jar
```

```bash
target/dist/bin/active-proxy.sh                  # reads ~/.config/boson/client/active-proxy.yaml
target/dist/bin/active-proxy.sh -c my-proxy.yaml
target/dist/bin/active-proxy.sh --help           # options and exit codes
```

Without a DHT node the service peer cannot be looked up, so `service.host` is required, and `announcePeer` has no effect. Only one instance may run per device key.
